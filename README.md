## 💡 About the project

> _ft_printf is an individual project at 42 Wolfsburg focused on recreating the standard C `printf` function from scratch. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of variadic functions, string manipulation, and formatted output in C. This project is a key milestone in building robust, reusable, and efficient C code for future challenges at 42._

For more detailed information, see the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/jonona912/42_ft_printf/blob/master/ft_printf_subject.pdf).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The project is written in C and requires the **`gcc` compiler** and standard **C libraries**.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, navigate to the project directory and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use `ft_printf` in your project, include its header:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"
```

Then link the compiled library when compiling your code.

## 📚 What I Learned
- This project reinforced the importance of thoroughly understanding requirements and specifications prior to beginning development. I learned firsthand that adding new features without sufficient initial planning can introduce significant complexity and challenges that otherwise were avoidable.
- Variadic functions in C (`stdarg.h`)
- Handling and parsing format strings
- Custom implementation of formatted output
- Robust error handling and debugging
